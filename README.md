## About Me   
Hello, my name is Paweena Chotprasert. I am currently a third-year student majoring in Data Science and Data Analytics at Burapha University. I am interested in data analysis, particularly in creating Data Visualization that transforms insights into easy-to-understand visuals. I am also interested in database management in a professional setting.

Additionally, I am eager to learn how to collaborate with teams in a real-world work environment, focusing on effective communication and coordination within an organization.
